## Why I chose Julia?

The language is yet not been recognized by most of the machine learning engineers. I personally like julia because of the simplicity and the speed of the language. The language is very easy to learn and the syntax is very similar to python. 

## How to install Julia?

The installation process is very simple. You can download the julia from the [official website of julia](https://julialang.org).

## How to run Julia?

I'll be mostly using jupyter notebooks for julia. You can install the jupyter notebook from the [official website of jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).

Incase you want to run julia in the terminal, you can simply type `julia` in the terminal and it will open the julia REPL.To run jula files in the terminal, you can type `julia filename.jl` in the terminal.

## Julia packages that I'll be using now and then

Julia now contains over 7,400 packages in its registry.
I'd like to start learning machine learning with julia using [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/about_mlj/).  
Below are some of the packages that I'll be using now and then: 
* Notebook: Pluto, IJulia, Jupyter 
* Package/environment management: Pkg
* Plotting: Plots, StatsPlots, LaTeXStrings, Measures, Makie
* Deep learning: Flux, Knet, Mocha
* Linear models: GLM 
  
*I'll keep on updating in case I use any other packages.*
